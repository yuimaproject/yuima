\details{
The full data records of past temperature, precipitation, and climate and environmental change derived from tree ring measurements. Parameter keywords describe what was measured in this data set. Additional summary information can be found in the abstracts of papers listed in the data set citations, however many of the data sets arise from unpublished research contributed to the International Tree Ring Data Bank. Additional information on data processing and analysis for International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) data sets can be found on the Tree Ring Page \url{https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology}.

The MWK151 is only a small part of the data relative to one tree and contains measurement of a tree's ring width in mm, from -608 to 1957.
